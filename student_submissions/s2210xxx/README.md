# Cutting Stock Problem - Mathematical Modelling (Fall 2024)


## Project Overview
This project addresses the **2D Irregular Cutting Stock Problem**, which aims to minimize trim loss while optimizing the usage of stock sheets. Two distinct policies were implemented and evaluated:
1. **Genetic Algorithm Policy**: A metaheuristic approach inspired by the principles of natural selection to optimize material placement.
2. **Stock Filled Ratio Heuristic**: A deterministic heuristic designed to minimize trim loss efficiently.

## Policies Description

### 1. Genetic Algorithm (GA) Policy
- **Objective**: Maximize material utilization while minimizing trim loss through an evolutionary process.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Population Initialization**: Initial solutions were generated by sorting items based on their area.
  - **Crossover**: Combined two parent solutions to create offspring, attempting to inherit the best traits of both.
  - **Mutation**: Introduced random changes to individuals to avoid premature convergence.
  - **Fitness Function**: Scored solutions based on a balance of minimizing trim loss and maximizing material usage.
- **Results**:
  - **Challenges**: 
    - The algorithm suffered from **premature convergence**, often finding the "best solution" after only a few generations.
    - It failed to achieve the intended optimization goals due to limitations in the implemented genetic operators.
    - The computational time was excessive, taking approximately **5-10 minutes** for random test cases, which is impractical for larger datasets.
  - As a result, the GA policy did not meet the expected standards for solving the problem effectively.

### 2. Stock Filled Ratio Heuristic
- **Objective**: Minimize trim loss by strategically placing items in stock sheets.
- **Approach**:
  - Items were sorted based on area or other heuristics.
  - Placement strategies aimed to minimize gaps and maximize material utilization.
- **Results**:
  - The heuristic policy demonstrated **quick and effective performance** for smaller datasets.
  - It provided competitive results in larger datasets, efficiently minimizing trim loss compared to the Genetic Algorithm.

## Results Summary
- **Trim Loss**: 
  - The heuristic policy consistently achieved **low trim loss** across randomly generated datasets.
  - The Genetic Algorithm policy failed to outperform the heuristic due to its inefficiencies and suboptimal implementations.
- **Performance**:
  - **Genetic Algorithm**: Slow, inefficient, and unable to generate optimal solutions within reasonable time.
  - **Heuristic Policy**: Fast and reliable, particularly for smaller and medium-sized datasets.
